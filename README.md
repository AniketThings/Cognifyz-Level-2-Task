- **Objective**: Analyze the text reviews to identify the most common positive and negative keywords, calculate the average review length, and explore the relationship between review length and rating.
- **Analysis**:
  - **Keyword Identification**: Identified frequently occurring positive and negative keywords in the reviews.
  - **Average Review Length**: Calculated the average length of restaurant reviews.
  - **Review Length vs Rating**: Explored the relationship between the length of reviews and the rating given by customers to understand if there’s any correlation between them.
